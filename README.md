# Artificial Intelligence Algorithms

Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence Algorithms repository! This project showcases implementations of various AI algorithms using Python. Each module is designed to be an educational tool to demonstrate the workings and applications of these algorithms.

## ‚ùì Introduction

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental artificial intelligence algorithms such as Perceptron, Simulated Annealing, and WalkSAT. These algorithms are core components in fields such as machine learning and optimization.

### Key Files

- **Perceptron.py**: Contains the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm. This module illustrates how a simple neural network adjusts its weights based on given inputs and desired outputs.

- **Simulated_Annealing.py**: Implements the Simulated Annealing algorithm with functions like `simu_annealing`, `simple_greedy_search`, and `h`. These functions demonstrate optimization via temperature-controlled random exploration.

- **Walk_SAT.py**: Implements the WalkSAT algorithm with functions such as `walk_sat`, `iff`, `flip`, `num2bol`, and `getnumber`. It's a local search algorithm for solving propositional logic satisfiability problems.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

To get started with this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MartinDuranSantos/Artificial_Intelligence_Algorithms.git
   ```

2. **Install necessary packages**:
Since this project contains Python scripts, ensure Python is installed on your machine.

Although requirements are not explicitly mentioned, you may use basic libraries like numpy. Install dependencies using:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

3. **Run the scripts**:
Execute any script directly via Python to see the algorithms in action:

    ```bash
    python Perceptron.py
    ```
